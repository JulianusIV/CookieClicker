This Privacy Policy governs the collection, use, storage, and disclosure of information by the Cookie Clicker Discord bot ("the Bot"). By adding the Bot to your server, you acknowledge and agree to the following terms.

### Data Collection
The Bot collects and securely stores data solely for the purpose of providing its services. The data collected by the Bot includes a generated button id that identifies the button clicked and enables the Bot to determine when the button was created, as well as the number of times a button has been clicked, which is displayed and updated on the button itself. The Bot will not collect any data that is not required for its services.

### Data Storage
All data collected by the Bot is stored securely in a publicly unavailable space. The Bot takes reasonable measures to protect collected data against unauthorized access or disclosure, alteration, or destruction. However, no method of transmission over the internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure.

### Third-Party Disclosure
The Bot will not share any collected data with third parties, except as required by law or legal process, or to protect the rights, property, or safety of the Bot, its users, or others.

### Changes to this Privacy Policy
This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time. The most current version of this Privacy Policy will be posted on the Bot's website. Your continued use of the Bot after any changes to this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such changes. The Bot will endeavor to inform users of any modifications to this Privacy Policy to the best of its ability.
